# Lrrr

Lrrr is a recreational golfing language designed to be easily
customizable.

## Todo:
- Infinite sequence creation/manipulation functions
- Filter/map/sort/reverse/other sequence manipulation functions
- Allow functions to accept the evaluated value of other contexts as input:
   e.g. 4+{7*6} should be acceptable and should return 4 + 42 = 46
